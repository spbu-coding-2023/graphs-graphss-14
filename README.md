## About the Application

Welcome to our Kotlin application, a comprehensive toolkit designed to facilitate the visualization, analysis, and storage of graph data. This application provides a user-friendly interface that empowers users to explore and manipulate graphs with ease.

## Key Features

- **Graph Plane Layout (Spring Embedder):** Efficiently arrange graph nodes for optimal visualization.
- **Highlighting Key Vertices:** Easily identify and emphasize critical nodes within the graph.
- **Search for Communities (Clustering):** Discover and group nodes into communities based on their connectivity.
- **Isolation of Strongly Connected Components (Kosarayu algorithm):** Identify and isolate subgraphs where every node is reachable from every other node.
- **Finding Bridges:** Locate and highlight the edges that, when removed, would increase the number of disconnected components.
- **Search for Cycles for a Given Vertex:** Trace and visualize cycles originating from a specified vertex.
- **Constructing a Minimal Spanning Tree (SpanningTree STP):** Build a tree that spans all vertices with the minimum total edge weight.
- **Finding the Shortest Path (Dijkstra's Algorithm):** Determine the shortest path between two vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- **Finding the Shortest Path (Ford-Bellman Algorithm):** Similarly, find the shortest path but with the Ford-Bellman algorithm.

## Important Notes

Please be aware that the following features are currently unavailable and have not been integrated into the current version of the application:

- **Search for Communities (Clustering)**
- **Constructing a Minimal Spanning Tree (SpanningTree STP)**

We are actively working on these features and plan to include them in future updates.
